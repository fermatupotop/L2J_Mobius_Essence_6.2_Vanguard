<html><body>Event Manager Santa Girl:<br>
Hello! My name is Santa Girl. I came here to celebrate the New Year. But I've been awfully busy lately, and I've been late getting ready, so it's only now that I realize some of the items are missing. I can't have a celebration without them.<br>
You look like a brave warrior. Therefore, I ask for your help in returning the missing item! Of course, not for nothing. I have special gifts for my assistants.<br>
